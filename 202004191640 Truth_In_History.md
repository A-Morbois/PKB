How can we trust the past ?
Is that reliable ?

we tend to filter what we remember.
Understand how the world is like that today will help us understand how it works

the goal is to understand the why an event occurs instead of just knowing the event itself. Make links between events.

We can learn from history but we have to take a macro view of the event. Using the micro it's not possible to know every interraction that happened, tons of them happens simultanesly etc...

>that simple people often know the truth better than learned men, because their observation of men and nature is less clouded by empty theories

>truth is based on perspective.

How we decide to look at the event, which angle we observe it...
