# Read Better
[A Helpful Guide to Reading Better](https://fs.blog/reading/)

3 level of reading :
- Entertainment
- Information
- Understanding

Focus on old book : Cf [[201912240902]] Antifragile
The older the book, the more it will last

>Think of reading as a conversation between you and the author


Remebering stuff :
1. **Before read** : create a mindmap / review your knowledge on the subject
2. **after read** : review the map and add new stuff with another color if possible
3. **Next session** : reread map


**Annotate** a book :
it engage you with the content, show your agreement or not with the author.
The author is a teacher on one subject, ask question, converse with him


# #Knowledge Assimilation 

[On Reading and Books](https://fs.blog/2015/08/schopenhauer-on-reading/)

>When we read, another person thinks for us : we merely repeat his mental process
>In reading, our head is, however, really only the arena of some one else’s thoughts

>. For the more one reads the fewer are the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a tablet that has been written over and over. Hence it is impossible to reflect

-> Prendre le temps de la réflexion apres chaque lecture.
Lire pour lire et ne pas y penser reviens à manger quand on a plus faim, le surplus ne sera pas consommé.
Réfléxion ou mise en application concrète.

>To desire that a man should retain everything he has ever read, is the same as wishing him to retain in his stomach all that he has ever eaten

# Mise En Application

- question avant de lire? Puis y répondre après
- Mindmap sur le sujet avant / puis compléter apres
- Prise de note pendant
- Relire après une certaine période
- poser des questions par rapport à ce qui a été lu
- chercher des correspondances / liens
- s'allouer 5 min apres chaque lecture pour review ce qui a été vu


# What to read

>If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking

know what to read, and what not to read.
Trusted and interesting people are a good way to get book recommendation.


# Content we read

[](https://medium.com/personal-growth/what-you-spend-time-reading-changes-your-brain-ee2ab4f2aa17)

News and clickbait are like junkfood. doesn't see the result over 1 week but over the years.
The mind is the same as the stomach, to be healthy, we need good nutriment.
>. Like alcohol, it’s just empty calories. You cannot subsist on a diet of alcohol alone.

-> solution, we can filter it:
- Time :
	Will the information be relevant in 10 hours, 10 month, 10 years
- Details
	is it just surface knowledge or in depth one?
