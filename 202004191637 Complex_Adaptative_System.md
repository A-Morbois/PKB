**CAS** : Complex Adaptative System 

## Definition
CAS : Many autonomous agent interdependent which create value through their interraction. (society, company, group of people)
The output is not predictable and cann't be predict from the behavior of its agent.
system > sum(agent)

Decentralized power, an agent react to the others
parallel action (competition or cooperation for instance)


## Caracteristics

- The advantage of those system is that they auto evolve themselve and do not need top down intervention
    >allowing systems to emerge through the interaction of people with software, rather than designing that use in advance.

- They adapt faster through its many links between all agents (less layers)
    >Networks adapt faster than hierarchies

- Small piece > big chunk 

## Though

- the more agent profile you analyze, the more it's possible to understand how a system works.

- They are too many variables to predict outcome. Even short-term one.

- Prevention > Correction afterward

- best practices is not a solution : 

    Agent are too different and they are too many context. What works for one may not be the solution for others. 
Analyse what was done but do not apply blindly whatever recommendation.

- Scale doesn't work well

It may works on small scale but fails to works on bigger 

- Agent Engagement will make a huge difference.
i.e. in a company, engage conversation with customer, front line salesman, ... feeling involve in the network make a better communication through all links
