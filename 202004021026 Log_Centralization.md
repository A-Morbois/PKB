[Centralisation des logs](https://blog.octo.com/partie-1-la-centralisation-de-logs-ou-comment-donner-de-la-valeur-a-vos-logs/)

* potential issue :
- DEV can not access the machine where are the logs
- OPS may not know what to look for when searching for logs because the dev did them
- Time to exchange logs between dev & ops (time to repair too long)

* assets of centralization :
- search engine
- one single interface

* what we can do 
- system health in real time
- pilot evolution (volume of calls for instance)
- get alert from unusual event
