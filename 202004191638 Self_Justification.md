Problematic of never really know the world around us.
From the start, it's not possible to get a full vision of what's happening, it's too complex :
- They are too many system
>Link Complex thinking

- Grasp fully the past is not possible
>Link Thruth in History

There isn't a single truth. It's the people perception that makes the truth.(Myth of the cavern)

Does self justification change the perception of our reality ?
Each Explanation, fact we understand is biais by default because it's seen by our own perspective. Someone else may understrand differently 

2 type of self-justification : 

1. People may not be consicious about the fact they self-justify something. They may be so deep in the story they made they don't get the fact they are wrong because in their perspective, what they did was the best choice possible.


2. People know something isn't good but they try to preserve their composure but lying on purpose and try to convince themselve they did it for a good reason.


self justification is like quicksand, the deeper you go, the harder it is to get out.

**Memory changes over time**
>We remember our past in a way that confirms what we believe of ourselves in the present.

This means that our truth, our definition of something will change, and so the self-justification about something, it's a self reninforcing loop.
