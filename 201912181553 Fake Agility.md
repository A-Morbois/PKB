## Some Agile Pillar
- Customer Focus
- Small Team
- Network

## Why it's hard

Discrepency between dev & other department
Dev frustrated from the slowness of the others

Manager that kill agile methodo by saying they are already agile
instead of scaling up all departements. Old habits are hard to change and complaints rise along the way 

Agile and Silo are opposite and bring conflicts.

## Scale agile

Big framework like SAFe forget about customer.
The focus shift more on the company internal organization
