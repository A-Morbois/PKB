## Logs Management :

 * Aggregation
 * Processing
 * Storage
 * Analysis


Beats -> Logstash -> Elasticsearch <- Kibana
Collect / Process  / Store  ; Query/ Visualize


Elasticsearch is nosql type queryable via API.

# Elisticsearch

## Common notions:

* Index : (database like) logical partition
* Document : (row like) base of unit storage
* Type : subdivision of document (depreciated)
* Mapping (Schema like)
* Shard : piece of index distributed on servers
* Replicas : copy of shard

## Different API

* Document
* Search
* Indices
* Clusters

# Logstash

>open source tool developed to handle the streaming of a large amount of log data from multiple sources.

## Config

 Input - Filter - Output
=> collection -  processing - dispatching

Need JVM to run


# Kibana

Run on node.js
use KQL


## Lifecycle

- **Hot**  index is actively being updated and queried.
- **Warm** index is no longer being updated, but is still being queried.
- **Cold** ​index is no longer being updated and is seldom queried. The information still needs to be searchable, but it’s okay if those queries are slower.
- **Delete** ​the index is no longer needed and can safely be deleted.
