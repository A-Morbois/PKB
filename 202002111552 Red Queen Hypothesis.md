System that co-exist like prey-predator are bound to each other.

If one evolve, the other one has to evolve as well or go extinct.

Exemple :
if predator run faster, the prey will be catch more often and may go extinct if the situation stay as is.
The prey can either :
	- go extinct
	- run faster 
	- evolve to get an advantage (like stealth for instance)

in this end, this is an non-ending race to evolution

Also, the prey need to better choose their mate to make sure their descendedant will have better chance of surviving, this will increase the competition between males
