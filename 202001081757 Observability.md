>it’s a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs. So in contrast to monitoring which is something we actually do, observability (as a noun), is more a property of a system.

>observability means you can answer any questions about what’s happening on the inside of the system just by observing the outside of the system, without having to ship new code to answer new questions. Observability is what we need our tools to deliver now that system complexity is outpacing our ability to predict what’s going to break.

System are now too complex that we can't predict what's going to break and so what to monitor.
So by observing the output of the application, we can see directly if something goes wrong.
