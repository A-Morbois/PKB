## Core principle :

1. Content are living things
2. Keep the number of choice to a minimum
3. Preview information to show if the user dig 
4. Exemple of content for categories
5. Assume that 50% of the users aren't coming from the homepage
6. Have different classification schemes
7. Keep it simple while browsing
8. Make it scalable  

## User type:

- **Know item** : they already know what they are looking for
- **Exploratory** : they come looking for inspiration
- **Exhaustive search** : they want to find as much information as possible
- **refinding** : they are looking for something they have founded in the past

## Business value (if bad IA):

- Knowledge deficit : employees reinventing the wheel cause they don't find the content
- Sales decreasing
- less new member
- marketing cost
- Bad SEO[^1] ranking 
- Increase cost of live help + docs
