# 202007101548 Container
tags = #Docker #Linux #Devops



when a new container is created, it is run in a namespace.
we can choose what other process the container can see (user, network, id, ...)
See linux namespace

with the command unshare, we can detach the process from its parent.

you can list the namespace of your process with 
```shell
ls -lha /proc/<ID>/ns/
```

CGroups limit the amount of resources a process can consume. These cgroups are values defined in particular files within the /proc directory.

cgroup of your process -> all cgroup of all process
/proc/<ID>/cgroup -> /sys/fs/cgroup/

Example: we can change the size limit of a containerby changing the value in :
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/docker/$DBID/memory.limit_in_bytes

>All actions with Linux is done via syscalls. The kernel has 330 system calls that perform operations such as read files, close handles and check access rights. All applications use a combination of these system calls to perform the required operations.

SecComp -> filter what call can be made by the process
